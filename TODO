* Edit code triggers github fork within squeak and commit
  - this code should be a github repo
  - for SSL go get help
* Save
  - via Monticello
  - via Github Button/Badge (top right corner) (like for me, just for saving)
     .. how determine which github project to save?
* Distinguish between fork/commit(save)


* Don't use all in One image, but Linux image instead
* WebVNC.start, alternatively local tighVNC
* Deploy remote Docker Container
* Change screen resoltion/use squeaks vnc/? ..put in install.st

* Use builderCI alike configuration

* Provision of squeak image?
* View anonymously
* Distinguish try and code (with provisioned github credientials)

* What were your Problems?

* Think about correct "better" github intergration, e.g. w/o filetree, because
I'm a normal Squeak user who wants to push his/her projects on github

* Pull request
